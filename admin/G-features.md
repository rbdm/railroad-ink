In addition to the features that are auto-graded, the graphical user interface
of our project implements the following features:

*(Remove those that are unimplemented)*
 
 - Fix the isTilePlacementWellFormed() of the RailroadInk class (Task 1,2)
 - Fix the isBoardStringWellFormed() method of the RailroadInk class (Task 3)
 - A basic game based on JAVAFX support player against ai. (Task 4, 9, 11)
 - Fix the areConnectedNeighbours() method of the RailroadInk class (Task 5)
 - Fix the isValidPlacementSequence() method of the RailroadInk class (Task 6)
 - Fix the generateDiceRoll() method of the RailroadInk class (Task 7)
 - Fix the getBasicScore() method of the RailroadInk class (Task 8)
 - Fix the generateMove() method of the RailroadInk class (Task 10)
 - Fix the getAdvancedScore() method of the RailroadInk class (Task 12)
